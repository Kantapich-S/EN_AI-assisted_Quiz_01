            {
                question: "The anterior pituitary gland comprises approximately what percentage of the total pituitary gland volume?",
                options: {
                    A: "60%",
                    B: "70%",
                    C: "80%",
                    D: "90%",
                    E: "95%"
                },
                correct: "C",
                explanation: "The anterior pituitary (adenohypophysis) makes up approximately 80% of the total pituitary gland volume, while the posterior pituitary comprises the remaining 20%. This anatomical fact is fundamental to understanding pituitary physiology and pathology. 60% and 70% underestimate the proportion, while 90% and 95% overestimate it."
            },
            {
                question: "Which cell type in the anterior pituitary is responsible for producing growth hormone?",
                options: {
                    A: "Lactotrophs",
                    B: "Corticotrophs",
                    C: "Thyrotrophs",
                    D: "Somatotrophs",
                    E: "Gonadotrophs"
                },
                correct: "D",
                explanation: "Somatotrophs are the specific cell type in the anterior pituitary that produces growth hormone (GH). Lactotrophs produce prolactin, corticotrophs produce ACTH, thyrotrophs produce TSH, and gonadotrophs produce FSH and LH. Understanding these cell-hormone relationships is essential for comprehending pituitary adenoma classifications."
            },
            {
                question: "What is the pathognomonic visual field defect associated with optic chiasm compression by a pituitary mass?",
                options: {
                    A: "Homonymous hemianopsia",
                    B: "Bitemporal hemianopsia",
                    C: "Monocular blindness",
                    D: "Central scotoma",
                    E: "Quadrantanopia"
                },
                correct: "B",
                explanation: "Bitemporal hemianopsia (loss of lateral visual fields) is pathognomonic for suprasellar mass lesions compressing the optic chiasm. This occurs because the crossing fibers from the nasal retina (responsible for temporal vision) are compressed. Homonymous hemianopsia suggests posterior visual pathway lesions, while monocular blindness, central scotoma, and quadrantanopia indicate different anatomical involvement."
            },
            {
                question: "Which hormone is most commonly elevated in functional pituitary adenomas?",
                options: {
                    A: "Growth hormone",
                    B: "ACTH",
                    C: "TSH",
                    D: "Prolactin",
                    E: "FSH"
                },
                correct: "D",
                explanation: "Prolactinomas are the most common functioning pituitary adenomas, accounting for approximately 30% of all pituitary adenomas. They are particularly common as microadenomas in women of reproductive age. Growth hormone-secreting adenomas, ACTH-secreting adenomas, and TSH-secreting adenomas are less common, while FSH-secreting adenomas are typically non-functioning clinically."
            },
            {
                question: "What percentage of anterior pituitary parenchyma must be lost before clinical hypopituitarism becomes apparent?",
                options: {
                    A: "25%",
                    B: "50%",
                    C: "65%",
                    D: "75%",
                    E: "90%"
                },
                correct: "D",
                explanation: "Approximately 75% of anterior pituitary parenchyma must be lost before clinical signs of hypopituitarism become apparent. This demonstrates the significant functional reserve of the pituitary gland. Lesser percentages (25%, 50%, 65%) are insufficient to cause clinical manifestations, while 90% would represent very severe destruction that would cause obvious symptoms much earlier in the disease process."
            },
            {
                question: "A 25-year-old woman presents with amenorrhea and galactorrhea. Before attributing these symptoms to a prolactinoma, which conditions must be excluded?",
                options: {
                    A: "Hypothyroidism and pregnancy",
                    B: "Diabetes mellitus and hypertension",
                    C: "Hyperthyroidism and menopause",
                    D: "Adrenal insufficiency and liver disease",
                    E: "Kidney disease and heart failure"
                },
                correct: "A",
                explanation: "Pregnancy and hypothyroidism are essential exclusions before diagnosing prolactinoma as the cause of hyperprolactinemia. Pregnancy naturally elevates prolactin levels, and hypothyroidism increases TRH, which stimulates prolactin release. The other combinations, while potentially relevant to general health assessment, are not primary causes of pathological hyperprolactinemia that would mimic prolactinoma."
            },
            {
                question: "Which genetic mutation is found in approximately 40% of growth hormone-secreting pituitary adenomas?",
                options: {
                    A: "MEN1 mutations",
                    B: "USP8 mutations",
                    C: "GNAS mutations",
                    D: "TP53 mutations",
                    E: "RET mutations"
                },
                correct: "C",
                explanation: "GNAS mutations are found in approximately 40% of somatotroph (growth hormone-secreting) adenomas. These mutations result in persistent cAMP generation and unchecked cellular proliferation. MEN1 mutations predispose to multiple adenoma types but are less specific to GH adenomas. USP8 mutations are associated with corticotroph adenomas. TP53 and RET mutations are not typically associated with pituitary adenomas."
            },
            {
                question: "What is the best screening test for acromegaly?",
                options: {
                    A: "Random growth hormone level",
                    B: "IGF-1 level",
                    C: "Oral glucose tolerance test",
                    D: "Growth hormone stimulation test",
                    E: "24-hour urine growth hormone"
                },
                correct: "B",
                explanation: "IGF-1 is the best screening test for acromegaly because it reflects integrated growth hormone secretion over time and is not subject to the pulsatile fluctuations that make random GH levels unreliable. The oral glucose suppression test is the gold standard for confirming diagnosis but is not used for screening. Growth hormone stimulation tests are used for GH deficiency, and 24-hour urine GH is not a standard test."
            },
            {
                question: "A 45-year-old man presents with enlarged hands and feet, prognathism, and excessive sweating. His condition developed after epiphyseal plate closure. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
                options: {
                    A: "Gigantism",
                    B: "Acromegaly",
                    C: "Cushing's disease",
                    D: "Hypothyroidism",
                    E: "Hyperparathyroidism"
                },
                correct: "B",
                explanation: "Acromegaly occurs when growth hormone excess develops after epiphyseal plate closure in adults, leading to enlargement of hands, feet, and facial features including prognathism. Gigantism occurs before epiphyseal closure in children and causes generalized body size increase. Cushing's disease would present with different features like moon facies and truncal obesity. Hypothyroidism and hyperparathyroidism do not typically cause these specific skeletal changes."
            },
            {
                question: "A postpartum woman cannot lactate and develops amenorrhea, fatigue, and inability to tan. What is the most likely underlying pathophysiology?",
                options: {
                    A: "Hypothalamic tumor",
                    B: "Postpartum thyroiditis",
                    C: "Pituitary apoplexy",
                    D: "Sheehan syndrome",
                    E: "Lymphocytic hypophysitis"
                },
                correct: "D",
                explanation: "Sheehan syndrome is ischemic necrosis of the pituitary following obstetric hemorrhage and shock. The inability to lactate (prolactin deficiency) is often the first manifestation, followed by other hormone deficiencies causing amenorrhea (gonadotropin deficiency), fatigue (ACTH/TSH deficiency), and inability to tan (ACTH deficiency). The pregnancy-enlarged pituitary is particularly vulnerable to ischemia without proportional blood supply increase."
            },
            {
                question: "What distinguishes Nelson syndrome from typical Cushing's disease?",
                options: {
                    A: "It occurs before adrenalectomy and causes hyperpigmentation",
                    B: "It occurs after bilateral adrenalectomy and causes hyperpigmentation",
                    C: "It occurs spontaneously and causes only mass effects",
                    D: "It occurs after unilateral adrenalectomy and causes diabetes",
                    E: "It occurs after thyroidectomy and causes visual symptoms"
                },
                correct: "B",
                explanation: "Nelson syndrome is characterized by a large, destructive pituitary adenoma that develops after bilateral adrenalectomy, with associated hyperpigmentation due to MSH co-secretion with ACTH. The pathogenesis involves loss of cortisol's inhibitory feedback on a pre-existing microadenoma, allowing uncontrolled growth. The timing (post-bilateral adrenalectomy) and hyperpigmentation are key distinguishing features."

            {
                question: "A 30-year-old woman presents with severe headache, nausea, vomiting, and visual field defects of sudden onset. She has a known pituitary adenoma. What is the most appropriate immediate management?",
                options: {
                    A: "Increase oral corticosteroids and schedule outpatient MRI",
                    B: "Prescribe analgesics and arrange routine endocrinology follow-up",
                    C: "Perform lumbar puncture to rule out meningitis",
                    D: "Obtain immediate neurosurgical consultation",
                    E: "Start dopamine agonist therapy and monitor closely"
                },
                correct: "D",
                explanation: "This presentation is consistent with pituitary apoplexy, a neurosurgical emergency involving hemorrhagic infarction of a pituitary adenoma. The sudden onset of severe headache, nausea, vomiting, and visual defects in a patient with known adenoma requires immediate neurosurgical evaluation due to potential for rapid clinical deterioration. Delaying treatment or pursuing other management options could be life-threatening."

                question: "A patient produces 4 liters of dilute urine daily. After DDAVP administration, urine osmolality increases by 60% at 60 minutes. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
                options: {
                    A: "Primary polydipsia",
                    B: "Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus",

                },
                correct: "C",
                explanation: "A >50% increase in urine osmolality following DDAVP administration indicates severe central diabetes insipidus. This response pattern demonstrates that the kidneys can respond to exogenous ADH, confirming that the problem is inadequate ADH secretion rather than renal resistance. Nephrogenic DI would show minimal or no response to DDAVP, while primary polydipsia and SIADH would present differently."

                    A: "The adenoma is too small to cause symptoms",
                    B: "She has a non-functioning adenoma causing mass effects and secondary hypogonadism",
                    C: "She has undiagnosed primary ovarian failure",
                    D: "The prolactin assay results are falsely normal",

                },
                correct: "B",
                explanation: "A 15mm adenoma (macroadenoma) with normal prolactin levels but causing mass effects (visual field defects) and secondary hypogonadism (amenorrhea from gonadotropin deficiency) is consistent with a non-functioning adenoma. These tumors cause symptoms through compression of normal pituitary tissue and adjacent structures rather than hormone excess. The size is significant enough to cause symptoms, prolactin would be elevated if it were a prolactinoma, and the pattern doesn't suggest primary ovarian failure or hypothalamic dysfunction."

                correct: "B",
                explanation: "Small-cell lung carcinoma is the most frequent cause of ectopic ADH secretion leading to SIADH. The clinical presentation of confusion, nausea, and seizures with severe hyponatremia (118 mEq/L) and low plasma osmolality (245 mOsm/kg) is classic for SIADH. The mechanism involves excessive ADH leading to water retention, dilutional hyponatremia, and decreased plasma osmolality. The other options don't explain this specific electrolyte and osmolality pattern."

                options: {

                },
                correct: "C",
                explanation: "ACTH deficiency (secondary adrenal insufficiency) best explains this presentation. The combination of fatigue, weight loss, hyponatremia, and low morning cortisol following traumatic brain injury is classic for ACTH deficiency. Importantly, aldosterone levels remain normal because aldosterone production is primarily regulated by the renin-angiotensin system, not ACTH. This distinguishes secondary from primary adrenal insufficiency. The other hormone deficiencies wouldn't cause this specific pattern."

                },
                correct: "B",
                explanation: "This describes Nelson syndrome, which could have been prevented by preoperative pituitary irradiation. The syndrome develops when loss of cortisol feedback allows an existing pituitary microadenoma to grow unchecked, causing mass effects and hyperpigmentation from ACTH/MSH excess. Pituitary irradiation before adrenalectomy can prevent this progression by treating the underlying pituitary adenoma. Corticosteroid replacement, unilateral adrenalectomy, thyroidectomy, or GH therapy would not address the fundamental problem."

                explanation: "The combination of acromegaly (pituitary adenoma), pancreatic islet cell tumors, and hyperparathyroidism (parathyroid adenoma/hyperplasia) is classic for Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) syndrome. MEN1 gene mutations predispose to multiple adenoma types affecting these three organ systems. While GNAS mutations occur in sporadic GH adenomas, the family history and multi-organ involvement strongly suggests MEN1. USP8 affects corticotroph adenomas, RET is associated with MEN2, and VHL causes different tumor patterns."

                explanation: "This represents Sheehan syndrome with multiple hormone deficiencies including hyponatremia suggesting possible ACTH deficiency. Hydrocortisone (for ACTH deficiency) must be started before levothyroxine (for TSH deficiency) because thyroid hormone replacement can precipitate adrenal crisis in untreated adrenal insufficiency by increasing cortisol metabolism. The combination of hydrocortisone and levothyroxine addresses the most life-threatening deficiencies first. Sex hormones and growth hormone are important but not immediately life-threatening."

She is started on cabergoline, but after 6 months, her prolactin increases to 150 ng/mL and the tumor enlarges to 18mm. What is the most likely explanation for this treatment failure?",

                },
                correct: "B",
                explanation: "When a pituitary lesion fails to respond to dopamine agonist therapy and actually grows larger with increasing prolactin levels, it's most likely a non-functioning adenoma causing stalk compression rather than a true prolactinoma. Non-functioning adenomas compress the pituitary stalk, interrupting dopamine transport and causing modest prolactin elevation (usually <100 ng/mL). These tumors don't respond to dopamine agonists and may continue growing. True prolactinomas typically shrink dramatically with dopamine agonist therapy. The clinical course described is inconsistent with medication non-compliance, receptor resistance, false lab values, or hypothyroidism."
